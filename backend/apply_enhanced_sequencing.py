Enhanced WMS Baseline Sequencing - Documentation

This script builds a realistic, entry-level WMS baseline plan for all waves in the database.

# Purpose
The goal is to create a baseline that mimics a typical, non-optimized WMS operation. This baseline is intentionally realistic but not highly efficient, so that the benefits of AI-driven optimization can be clearly demonstrated in comparison.

# How the Baseline Plan is Built
1. **Order Sorting**: For each wave, all orders are sorted by shipping deadline (earliest first) and then by priority (highest first). This reflects a basic WMS focus on urgent and important orders.

2. **Zone Grouping**: Orders are grouped by warehouse zone to simulate basic batching and reduce travel time, but without advanced optimization.

3. **Worker Assignment**: Workers are assigned to picking based on availability and basic skill matching (if available). No advanced labor balancing is performed.

4. **Equipment Constraints**: Equipment (e.g., packing stations) is allocated based on availability. If all equipment is busy, orders wait in queue.

5. **Stage Progression**: As picking progresses, a portion of staff is reallocated to consolidation and packing. When packing is underway, staff are further reallocated to labelling, staging, and shipping as work becomes available.

6. **Queue Management**: If a stage is blocked (no available staff or equipment), orders wait in a queue until resources free up. This models real-world bottlenecks.

7. **Wave Assignment Update**: The script updates the database with the new, realistic order and task sequencing for each wave, overwriting any previous baseline plan.

# Usage
- Run this script to apply the baseline logic to all waves in the database.
- The resulting plan can be compared to an optimized plan to highlight the value of advanced optimization.

# Limitations
- No advanced batching, routing, or labor balancing is performed.
- No learning or adaptation; the logic is static and basic.
- Designed to be realistic for a small/entry-level WMS, not a best-in-class operation.
